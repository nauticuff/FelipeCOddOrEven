Peer Reviewed: Griffin Parker

This program does everything it is supposed to! It takes your number, checks if it actually is a number, if it confirms that it is indeed a number, it will let you know if it is an odd or even number, along with a little textual flair. It then asks if you want to replay the program to test another number. It checks if you type 'yes' to restart the program or 'no' to end the program, makes whatever you type in uppercase, and will continue to loop until you type "yes" or "no". This program does everything it needs to, but I still think the user side of the experience could look a bit better. I think adding Console Clears every so often or on every loop helps keep the terminal looking tidy. Good job!
